# Image Colorization Starter Code
The objective is to produce color images given grayscale input image. 

## Setup Instructions
Create a conda environment with pytorch, cuda. 

`$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia`

For systems without a dedicated gpu, you may use a CPU version of pytorch.
`$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch`

## Dataset
Use the zipfile provided as your dataset. You are expected to split your dataset to create a validation set for initial testing. Your final model can use the entire dataset for training. Note that this model will be evaluated on a test dataset not visible to you.


## how to run
--first put the image on data
